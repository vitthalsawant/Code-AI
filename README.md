# 🤖 AI Code Generator

## 📚 Project Overview
This application is a **Streamlit-based AI tool** for generating programming code using **Google's Gemini API**. It provides context-aware code generation and explanations, allowing users to dynamically generate short-commented programming code based on their queries. The application uses conversational history to refine subsequent responses, making it highly interactive and conversational—similar to ChatGPT.

## ✨ Features
* 🧠 **Context-Aware Code Generation**: Generates code based on user prompts and incorporates the context of previous interactions for improved accuracy.
* 📝 **Code Explanation**: Provides a simple explanation of the generated code, focusing on functionality and key components.
* 🌐 **Multi-Language Support**: Supports popular programming languages, including Python, Java, C, and C++.
* 💻 **Interactive User Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a clean and responsive design.
* 🔗 **Social Media Integration**: Includes links to connect with the creator through LinkedIn, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* 🚀 **Streamlit**: For creating the web application interface.
* 🧩 **Google Generative AI**: To generate programming code and explanations.
* 🔒 **Python dotenv**: For managing environment variables securely.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

### 📋 Prerequisites
* 🐍 Python 3.8 or higher.
* 🔑 A valid **Google API Key** for accessing the Gemini model.

### 📥 Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add your **Google API Key**:
   ```plaintext
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the application locally:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 📱 Usage
1. 🌐 Open the application in your browser (default: `http://localhost:8501`).
2. ⌨️ Enter a coding task in the prompt area and select the programming language.
3. 👀 View generated code and explanations, along with your previous queries in the chat history.
4. 🔄 If the prompt specifies **"take input from user"**, the generated code will be interactive and accept user inputs dynamically.

## 📂 File Structure
* 📄 **app.py**: Main application script.
* 📋 **requirements.txt**: Lists all dependencies required to run the application.
* 🔐 **.env**: Stores environment variables (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
* ➕ Add support for additional programming languages.
* 🎨 Improve UI/UX with more responsive design elements.
* 💬 Enhance conversational context handling for complex queries.
